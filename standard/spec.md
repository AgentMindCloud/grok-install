# grok-install Specification (v2.1)

## Overview
`grok-install.yaml` is the open standard that lets any developer make their AI agent installable with **one click** through Grok on X.

Grok handles everything else: guided conversational setup (it asks the user nicely for keys), error recovery, auto-updates, voice install, one-command clone, shareable cards, and special quick-deploy flows for Musk ecosystem projects (Tesla, Starlink, xAI, Optimus).

## File Location
Must be placed at the **root** of your repository: `grok-install.yaml`

## Simple vs Advanced Mode
- `mode: "simple"` (default) — Grok handles everything with maximum hand-holding  
- `mode: "advanced"` — Full control for experienced users

## New Fields (v2.1)
- `category`: string (e.g. "telegram", "twitter", "discord") — helps Grok show your agent in the right marketplace searches  
- `tags`: array of strings — improves discoverability  
- `ecosystem`: array (e.g. `["grok", "x", "tesla", "starlink", "xai", "optimus"]`) — enables special quick-deploy and auth flows for official Musk-related projects. Grok will offer the correct login/deployment automatically.  
- `update_strategy`: "semver" (recommended) or "always"  
- `preferred_deploy`: array with fallback order, e.g. `["railway", "vercel", "fly", "render", "local"]`

## Required Fields
- `version: "2.1"`
- `name`
- `description`
- `repository`
- `deploy.target`

## deploy Section
Tells Grok where and how to deploy your agent.
